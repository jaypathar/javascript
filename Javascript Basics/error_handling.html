        *There are diffrent types of  errors in javascipt.
        Syntax:Missing Semicolon or any miistakes that are not within the rules of syntax.
        logical: errors in the logic of program i.e: 2+2 = 5
        runtime: occurwhen something  goes wrong at runtime i.e not enough disk space etc.
        reference: trying to use a variable which is not decalred
        type_error: trying to apply math function to a string i.e. toFixed()
        Similarly error handling can be done using the try-catch block as shown below.
         **/

      //->whenever an error occurs and  error object is created which has a error name and error message.
      //Exception handling: try,catch,finally,throw
      try {
        document.write("hello<br>");
        document.writing("hello"); //There is no function called 'document.writing()'
      } catch (e) {
        //If there are no issues in the try block,  the catch block won't be executed
        document.write("the error name is " + e.name + "<br>");
        document.write("<br>");
        document.write("The error message is " + e.message + "<br>");
      } finally {
        //Write code that must run irrespective if the  exception is generated or not.
        document.write(
          "This is Excecuted whether execution is is generated or not"
        );
